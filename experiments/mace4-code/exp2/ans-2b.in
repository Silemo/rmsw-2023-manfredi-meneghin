% Define the domain: two individuals, A and B.
set(domain_size). % Set this to 2 because we have two individuals

% Define the predicates: Knight and Knave
% Knight(x) means x is a knight
% Knave(x) means x is a knave

% Axiom 1: Everyone is either a knight or a knave, but not both.
forall(x, (Knight(x) | Knave(x)) & ~(Knight(x) & Knave(x))).

% Axiom 2: Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.
% Thi means that if x is a Knight and says P, then P must be true.
% If x is a Knave and says P, then P must be false.

% Axiom 3: The first person (A) says "We are the same".
% This statement can be interpreted as: "A and B are both knights or both knaves"
% We need to represent this in terms of truth and lies
forall(x, forall(y, (Knight(x) & (Knight(x) <-> Knight(y))) | (Knave(x) & (Knight(x) <-> Knight(y))))).

% Now we ask Mace4 to find a model that satisfies all the axioms.
% If Mace4 finds a model, it means that the situation described is consistent with the rules of knights and knaves.
