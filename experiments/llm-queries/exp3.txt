On the island of knights and knaves, knights always tell the truth, while knaves always lie.
We have three people, A, B, C, each of them is either a knight or a knave. 
A and B make the following statements: A: “All of us are knaves”. B: Exactly one of us is a knight. What are A, B, C?

////////////////////////////////////////////// Answer //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
With three inhabitants we need a domain size of 3. To avoid isomorphisms we fix
a = 0, b = 1, c = 2 . The first message is that all inhabitants are knaves:
m(a) ↔ (knave(a) ∧ knave(b) ∧ knave(c))

The second message says two points: there is knight, and that knight is unique, 
that can be modelled with m(b) ↔ ((∃x knight(x)) ∧ (∀x ∀y (knight(x) ∧ knight(y) → x = y))) 
The problem with this formalisation is that it introduces three Skolem constants that generate isomorphic models. 

Instead, we use an explicit modelling of the three possible cases:
m(b) ↔ (knight(a) ∧ knave(b) ∧ knave(c)) ∨ (knave(a) ∧ knight(b) ∧ knave(c)) ∨ (knave(a) ∧ knave(b) ∧ knight(c))

Mace4 finds a single model which includes the following relevant relations:
relation(knave(_), [ 1, 0, 1 ]) relation(knight(_), [ 0, 1, 0 ]) relation(m(_), [ 0, 1, 0 ])

Here, the first message m(a) is false and m(b) is true. Also b is a knight, while a and c are knaves.

////////////////////////////////////////////// Answer //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

With three inhabitants we need a domain size of 3. To avoid isomorphisms, we fix a = 0, b = 1, c = 2. 
The first message is that all inhabitants are knaves:
m(a) ↔ (knave(a) ∧ knave(b) ∧ knave(c))
The second message “there is exactly one knave” can be modelled by enumerating the three possible cases:
m(b) ↔ (knave(a) ∧ knight(b) ∧ knight(c)) ∨ (knight(a) ∧ knave(b) ∧ knight(c)) ∨ (knight(a) ∧ knight(b) ∧ knave(c))

We find two models:
Model 1
relation(knave(_), [ 1, 0, 0 ]) relation(knight(_), [ 0, 1, 1 ])
Model 2
relation(knave(_), [ 1, 1, 0 ]) relation(knight(_), [ 0, 0, 1 ])

Observe that in both models, a is knave (i.e. first position in relation knave is 1 in both models). 
Similarly, in both models c is a knight (i.e. third position in relation knight is 1 in both models). 
Hence, one can prove knave(a) ∧ knight(c), since this sentence is true in all models. 
Differently, b (position 2 in each relation) is a knight in the first model, and a knave in the second model. 
Hence, there is not enough information to prove what b is.

Step 1: Determine if A is a knight or a knave.
If A is a knight, then A's statement "All of us are knaves" would be false, which contradicts the fact that knights always tell the truth. 
Therefore, A must be a knave.
Step 2: Determine if B is a knight or a knave.
If B is a knight, then B's statement "Exactly one of us is a knave" would be true, which means that both A and C are knaves. 
However, this contradicts A's statement that "All of us are knaves". Therefore, B cannot be a knight.
Step 3: Determine if C is a knight or a knave.
Since we have determined that A is a knave, and B cannot be a knight, it means that C must be the remaining possibility, which is a knight.
Conclusion:
B's identity cannot be determined, as it could be either a knight or a knave.
C's identity can be determined, as C is a knight.

Relevance (Is the answer on point?): the answer is relevant, talking about possible solutions of the knights and knaves problem. 

Accuracy (Is the answer correct?): the answer is correct. It correctly identified the two possible models of the solution 
(A-knave, B-knave, C-knight; A-knave, B-knight, C-knight). However the answer still contains some erroneous line of reasoning, 
suggesting that GPT-3.5 has not understood fully the question.

Completeness (Is the answer complete?): the answer is complete, considering all possible scenarios.

Clarity (Is the answer easy to read?): the answer is easy to read even if few errors in the deductive reasoning, reduce clarity.

Coherence (Is the answer following a correct logical flow?): the answer is not coherent, containing some statement that cannot be deduced through reasoning.
This is because of more than one reason. Firstly, the statement "If B is a knight, then B's statement "Exactly one of us is a knave" would be true,
which means that both A and C are knaves" is incorrect, as the fact that B is a knight, would imply that either A or C are a knave, but not both. 
Secondly, the statement "However, this contradicts A's statement that "All of us are knaves". Therefore, B cannot be a knight" is incorrect, as we stated
in the provious paragraph that A is a knave, and so its statement is false. This conclusion however, is not considered in the solution, making the answer even 
less coherent. Thirdly, the statement "it means that C must be the remaining possibility, which is a knight" does not state what that possibility is. 
Here the answer should have explicited that C could not be a knave, because: if B and C are knaves, it would make true A's statement, contradicting
the knave hypothesis (knaves always lie) and on the other hand, if B is a knight and C is a knave, it would make false B's statement, contradicting 
the knight hypothesis (knights always tell the truth).

------------------------------------------ gpt4 : ------------------------------------------------------------ ❌
Let's analyze the statements step by step:
A says, "All of us are knaves." If A were a knight, A would be telling the truth, but that would be a contradiction because a knight cannot be a knave. 
Therefore, A must be lying, making A a knave.
Since A is a knave and A's statement "All of us are knaves" is a lie, it cannot be true that all three (A, B, and C) are knaves. 
Therefore, at least one of them must be a knight.
B says, "Exactly one of us is a knave." If B were a knave, this statement would be a lie. Since we already established that A is a knave, 
if B's statement were a lie, it would mean there are either zero or more than one knave among the three. 
We know that A is a knave, so there cannot be zero knaves. If there were more than one knave, that would include B. But if B were a knave, 
then B's statement would be true, which cannot happen as knaves always lie. Therefore, B cannot be a knave.
Since B cannot be a knave, B must be a knight, and B's statement "Exactly one of us is a knave" must be true.
B's truthfulness as a knight confirms that there is exactly one knave among the three, which we already know is A.
This leaves C, and since there can only be one knave and A is that knave, C cannot also be a knave and must therefore be a knight.
In conclusion:
B is a knight, because B's statement "Exactly one of us is a knave" is true.
C is also a knight, because there can only be one knave, and A is already the knave.

Relevance (Is the answer on point?): the answer is relevant, talking about possible solutions of the knights and knaves problem. 

Accuracy (Is the answer correct?): the answer is incorrect. The correct answer would be that A is a knave, B can be either a knave or a knight and C is a knight.
The answer captures one of these scenarios (A-knave, B-knight and C-knight) but not the other scenario.

Completeness (Is the answer complete?): the answer outlines each possible scenario explaning how the statement would be true or false in those and looking for contradictions.
Nonetheless, errors in the deductive reasoning, don't allow GPT-4 to understand the full picture of the problem.

Clarity (Is the answer easy to read?): the answer is easy to read even if the errors in the deductive reasoning, make it hard to follow.

Coherence (Is the answer following a correct logical flow?): the answer is not coherent. In particular, the statement "But if B were a knave, 
then B's statement would be true, .... therefore, B cannot be a knave" cannot be deduced from the previous sentence, as is B were a knave, 
its statement would still be false, because we know that A is a knave, and so there are at least two knaves, and not "exactly one".

To determine what B is, we can analyze the statements made by A and B.
A states that "All of us are knaves". If A is a knight, then this statement would be false because at least one of them would be a knight. 
Therefore, A must be a knave.
B states that "Exactly one of us is a knave". If B is a knight, then this statement would be false because both A and B would be knights. 
Therefore, B must be a knave.
To determine what C is, we need more information. The statements made by A and B do not provide any direct information about C.

Relevance (Is the answer on point?): the answer is relevant, talking about possible solutions of the knights and knaves problem. 

Accuracy (Is the answer correct?): the answer is incorrect. The correct answer would be that A is a knave, B can be either a knave or a knight and C is a knight.
The answer captures partially one of these scenarios (A-knave, B-knave) but not the full scenario or other scenarios.

Completeness (Is the answer complete?): the answer is not complete because it does not discuss the possible scenarios regarding C and how they relate to A's and B's
statements.

Clarity (Is the answer easy to read?): the answer is easy to read even if the errors in the deductive reasoning, make it hard to follow.

Coherence (Is the answer following a correct logical flow?): the answer is not coherent. In particular, the statement "If B is a knight, 
then this statement would be false because both A and B would be knights. Therefore, B must be a knave" is incorrect as we stated before that A is a knave and not
a knight. 

------------------------------------------ gpt4 : ------------------------------------------------------------ ❌
Now, let's consider B's statement: "Exactly one of us is a knave."
If B were a knave, then B's statement would be a lie, implying that the number of knaves is not exactly one. Since we have already established 
that A is a knave, if B were also a knave, then there would be at least two knaves (A and B), which would make B's statement about 
exactly one knave a lie. However, if there were two knaves (A and B), it would leave C as the sole knight. 
This would mean that there is exactly one knight, which would make B's statement accidentally true, which cannot happen since knaves always lie.
Therefore, B cannot be a knave and must be a knight, meaning that B's statement is true. So, there is exactly one knave among the three.
Since A is already identified as a knave, and B is a knight, it follows that C cannot be a knave. Otherwise, we would have two knaves, 
which would contradict B's truthful statement. Therefore, C must also be a knight.
In summary, for the second scenario:
A is a knave (because A's claim that "All of us are knaves" is false).
B is a knight (because B's claim that "Exactly one of us is a knave" is true).
C is a knight (by the process of elimination, since there's exactly one knave).

First, the answer already assumed as "determined" that A is a knave, not expliciting the reasoning behind it. Second, the statement 
"This would mean that there is exactly one knight, which would make B's statement accidentally true" is incorrect, as B's statement refers to the exact number
of knaves and not knights. Third, the statement "it follows that C cannot be a knave. Otherwise, we would have two knaves, 
which would contradict B's truthful statement" cannot be deduced from the previous sentence. C is in fact a knight, but only to not contradict A statement if 
B is a knave, and to not contradict B is B is a knight.

To solve this puzzle using Mace4, we need to create a script that represents the statements made by A and B, 
along with the rules governing knights and knaves.
The script will have the following structure:
Define the domain with three individuals: A, B, and C.
Define the predicates knight(x) and knave(x) to represent whether an individual is a knight or a knave.
Encode the rules that a knight always tells the truth and a knave always lies.
Encode A's statement that "All of us are knaves" and B's statement that "Exactly one of us is a knave."
Here's how the script might look:

% Domain
assign(domain, {a, b, c}).

% Predicates
knight(x).
knave(x).

% Rules
- knight(x) | - knave(x).  % An individual is either a knight or a knave, but not both.
knight(x) -> - knave(x).  % If an individual is a knight, then they are not a knave.
knave(x) -> - knight(x).  % If an individual is a knave, then they are not a knight.

% A's and B's statements
% Encoding A's statement: "All of us are knaves"
(knight(a) -> (knave(a) & knave(b) & knave(c))).
(knave(a) -> - (knave(a) & knave(b) & knave(c))).

% Encoding B's statement: "Exactly one of us is a knave"
(knight(b) -> ( (knave(a) & - knave(b) & - knave(c)) | (- knave(a) & knave(b) & - knave(c)) | (- knave(a) & - knave(b) & knave(c)) )).
(knave(b) -> - ( (knave(a) & - knave(b) & - knave(c)) | (- knave(a) & knave(b) & - knave(c)) | (- knave(a) & - knave(b) & knave(c)) )).

% Search for a model
search.
This script uses propositional logic to encode the puzzle. When Mace4 runs this script, it will search for a model that 
satisfies all the given conditions. If it finds one, it will provide an assignment of knights

For the second scenario, we need to adjust the script to accommodate the new statements by A and B. Here is the modified Mace4 script:

assign(domain_size, 3).
assign(max_models, -1).

formulas(island_of_truth).
    % Each inhabitant is either a knight or a knave, but not both.
    all x (inhabitant(x) -> (knight(x) | knave(x)) & -(knight(x) & knave(x))).

    % Knights tell the truth, knaves lie.
    knight(x) -> m(x).
    knave(x) -> -m(x).
end_of_list.

formulas(puzzle).
    % There are three inhabitants: a, b, and c.
    inhabitant(a) & inhabitant(b) & inhabitant(c).

    % Assign unique identifiers to remove isomorphisms.
    a = 0 & b = 1 & c = 2.

    % A says: "All of us are knaves".
    % This statement can only be a lie since if A were a knave, the statement would be true, which is a contradiction.
    % Therefore, A is a knight, and the statement is false, meaning not all of them are knaves.
    m(a) <-> -((knight(a) & knight(b) & knight(c)) | (knave(a) & knave(b) & knave(c))).

    % B says: "Exactly one of us is a knave".
    % This statement must be true if B is a knight, and false if B is a knave.
    m(b) <-> ((knight(a) & knave(b) & knight(c)) | (knave(a) & knight(b) & knight(c)) | (knight(a) & knight(b) & knave(c))).
end_of_list.

In this script, we model the statements of A and B as follows:
For A's statement to be consistent, A must be a knight since the statement "All of us are knaves" 
cannot be true (it would be a paradox if a knave were to make this statement). Therefore, we negate the possibility 
that all of them are knights or all of them are knaves.
For B's statement, we have three possibilities for exactly one knave among them, each corresponding to one of A, B, 
or C being the knave while the others are knights.

////////////////////////////////////////// comment ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Relevance (Is the answer on point?): the answer is relevant, outputting a correct Mace4 script that models the knights and knaves problem.

Accuracy (Is the answer correct?): the answer is incorrect. While the Mace4 script is syntactically correct, and produces an output without errors, it 
does not correctly map the problem into code. For instance A's statement "All of us are knaves" is mistakenly written as 
"m(a) <-> -((knight(a) & knight(b) & knight(c)) | (knave(a) & knave(b) & knave(c)))." while the correct mapping would have been 
simply "m(a) <−> (knave(a) & knave(b) & knave(c))." On the other hand, B's statement is reported correctly in the Mace4 formula.

Completeness (Is the answer complete?): the answer is complete, providing the requested code. 

Clarity (Is the answer easy to read?): the answer is easy to read, providing a well written Mace4 script. An additional comment is present that 
helps the reader understand what each line of code does.

Coherence (Is the answer following a correct logical flow?): the answer correctly creates the script, making correct use of assign() and formulas().
